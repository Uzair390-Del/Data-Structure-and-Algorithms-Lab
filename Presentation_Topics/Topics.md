# Presentation Topics

**Instructor: Uzair Hassan**

 ## 1. Data Structures Overview
- Types of data structures
- Importance and applications of data structures in real-world scenarios

## Arrays in C++
- Applications and limitations of arrayss
- Array manipulation: insertion, deletion, and traversal

## Sorting Algorithms
- Comparison of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort
- Real-life applications of sorting algorithms

## Analysis of Sorting Techniques
- Time and space complexity of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort
- Scenarios where each sorting algorithm is most efficient

## Stacks
- Applications of stacks in real-world problems
- Implementing a stack using an array vs. using a linked list

## Queues
- Types of queues: Simple queue, circular queue, priority queue
- Real-world applications of queues (e.g., job scheduling, task management)

## Linked Lists
- Difference between arrays and linked lists
- Advantages of linked lists over arrays in dynamic memory management

## Singly Linked List
- Implementation of basic operations: insertion, deletion, and traversal
- Dry run of inserting and deleting nodes at specific positions

## Doubly Linked List
- Comparison of singly and doubly linked lists
- Advantages of doubly linked lists for specific applications

## Queue Implementation using Linked List
- Benefits of using a linked list for queue implementation
- Detailed comparison of array-based vs. linked list-based queue implementations

## Sorting Linked Lists
- Techniques for sorting a linked list
- Practical use cases of sorted linked lists

## Data Structure Applications
- How to choose the right data structure for a given problem
- Case studies of real-world problems solved using data structures

### Optional Advanced Topics (For Better Preparation)

1. **Use Cases of Stacks and Queues**
   - How stacks and queues are used in compilers, operating systems, and databases
