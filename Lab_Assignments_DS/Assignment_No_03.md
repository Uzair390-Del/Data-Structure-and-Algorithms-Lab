# Assignment 3: Doubly Linked List in C++

## Objective:
Learn the concepts of Doubly Linked Lists, including their structure, advantages, operations, and implementations in C++. This assignment will assess your understanding of the topics covered in the last lab.

## Tasks:

### Introduction:
- Briefly describe a Doubly Linked List, its components, and how it differs from other data structures like Singly Linked Lists and Arrays.

### Node Structure in C++:
- Write the code to define a Node structure in C++.

### Implementation of Operations:
- Write and explain code snippets for:
  - Inserting a node at the beginning and at the end of the Doubly Linked List.
  - Deleting a node by value.
  - Traversing the list forward and backward.

### Practical Applications:
- List and explain at least three real-world applications of Doubly Linked Lists.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- Discuss the time complexity of insertion, deletion, traversal, and search operations in Doubly Linked Lists.

### Comparison with Other Data Structures:
- Compare Doubly Linked Lists with Singly Linked Lists and Arrays, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

## Submission Instructions:
- Submit your assignment in **handwritten form**.
- Include code snippets and explanations where required.
- Ensure neat and organized work.

## Deadline:
Submit the assignment **before the OHT**.
